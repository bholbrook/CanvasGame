/* Notes

TODO:
Add enemy/bullet collision detection and enemy removal
Add score overlay
Add points for destroying enemies
Add timer with random enemies spawning in random top area of screen

NOTES:
Need to build a List object so that can replace all Arrays with Lists to use the removeAt(i) function to fix bug 1.

BUGS:
1. splice function does not remove from array properly, is causing problems with collision detection and outOfBounds
